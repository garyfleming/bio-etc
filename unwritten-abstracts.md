# Unwritten Abstracts

This is a list of talks for which I've written an abstract but, for one reason or another, have yet to turn it into a full
talk. If they've become full talks, they likely appear as their own repos.

Some have appeared in other forms, some have changed into other things, and the list is FAR from complete. There are
at least a dozen talks for which I've got an idea but haven't progressed them as far as needing an abstract for them.

## Quality First, Safety Throughout

The traditional software cycle sees work come from analysis, through development, checked for quality by testers, then deployed. However, there are often a number of dysfunctions in this flow. What does our flow look like when we want to deploy constantly? How do we ensure quality from the start, not at the end? More importantly, how do we take our teams from where they are to this new way of thinking while ensuring they feel safe?

## Agile Without Ceremony

Retrospectives. Standups. Sprint Planning. Agile as practiced is fully of ceremonies that people follow to understand their work. The manifesto, however, doesn't mention any of these ceremonies. What would it look like, then, if we did agile without any of the ceremonies? How could we achieve the same goals without the rituals? Let's talk about the value in each of the more common ceremonies, and consider some alternatives. Let's do Agile without Ceremony.

## TDD thing

"How can you write the tests BEFORE the thing you're testing? Madness."

Test-Driven Development, or TDD, is one of the great technical religious wars. On one side, people who want to see it burn at the stake. On the other, people who yell at non-believers with zeal. As always, the truth lies somewhere between.

During this session, you'll learn a bit more about why TDD works, why it can be tricky, and when not to use it. With practice and some simple rules, you'll see how to write code that is works, is clearer, and supports future changes more readily.

## Continuous Testing

Statement (100 chars): Only testing after development drives dysfunction. Let's get quality earlier and collaboratively. Let's get rid of the "Test" column.

Key learnings:
* Learn why a Test column on your board might not be helping you
* See how to change your teams process to get testers involved earlier.
* Explore Example Mapping and User Story Mapping as techniques for getting questions of quality asked earlier.
* See how we can go beyond our tools to have meaningful conversations about doing better.

Testing is an afterthought in far too many teams, and is often visualised in our Kanban boards as simply being after development. By only involving testers after software has already been developed, we lose the opportunity to have valuable insights into what might go wrong or to explore areas that developers and product owners have yet to consider.

Moreover, in a Continuous Delivery world, this is simply no longer viable: we need quality in upfront and throughout our work. We no longer have time to find bugs later and redevelop.

We need quality beyond testing. We need testers involved throughout the process.

In this talk, I'll show you how to break out of the test column, and provide you with tools to use (like Example Mapping) in order to work better with your entire team. Through collaboration, communication, and exploration, I'll show you how to help your team from the very beginning of development, not just at the end.

## Better User Stories Through Example Mapping

100 Chars: Example Mapping is a fantastic tool for collaborating towards a shared understanding of our work.

### Description

We often struggle when it comes to figuring out exactly how we should work together, as testers, developers, business analysts, and product owners.

Three Amigos gets thrown around a lot as an idea: one to build, one to enquire, one to specify. But how do we actually run a three amigos session so that everyone gets their ideas across and we gain genuine shared understanding? That's tricky.

During this session, you'll learn to use Example Mapping; a simple, easy, and quick technique to bring everyone together for effective results.

## Collaboration Techniques with Example Mapping

Work linearly (product owner, dev, test)
Then work collaboratively (example mapping)

## Beyond Gherkin

After we've had our conversations, Gherkin has been the structure we've used to capture our needs for automation for quite some time. Gherkin isn't going anywhere but perhaps there are other forms we can use to capture conversations that are closer to how we had the conversations. Could we digitise our example mapping cards? Could we use mind maps? What other formats could we use to take us beyond Gherkin?

## WORKING TITLE: The Effective but Lazy Meetup/Guided Conversations

NOT AN ABSTRACT YET, JUST AN IDEA: Guided Conversations helped us have effective meetups that were easy to organise and lazy. Talk about Guided Conversations: the where they came from, why, how they work, strengths, weaknesses etc. Maybe talk about other things we've learned to about running meetups and organisation.

# The Sleeping Hero

NOT AN ABSTRACT YET, JUST AN IDEA: "Be a hero? I'd rather sleep." Talk about hero culture, firefighting, and why boring is better. It lets us focus on the things that matter (customers, interactions value) rather than worry about the technology.

# Storytelling

NOT AN ABSTRACT YET, JUST AN IDEA: I’ve often thought we should train new devs in the art of storytelling.

Stories have an arc. Scenes have a purpose. Waste is edited out.

# Slicing over Scaling

Focus on breaking down dependencies rather than creating rigid structures. Self-organising teams with autonomy/mastery/purpose are better than teams told what to do. City metaphor? You can create a tonne of structure around building a skyscraper, but if you want to build a city then you need to radically drop structure. Centrally planned cities are mostly ghost towns (in China). You don’t get a London, Barcelona, Glasgow (character) by “scaling”

Non-linear visualisation of features and their possible futures until they’re removed. Continuous testing is involved. (If a talk, an interesting frame might be to open with the ending, then loop back round to it). This tweet thread and tree of replies explains more: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1179112032630693888

CoP talk: use to drive experimentation. Learn something? Try it elsewhere. Questions raised/puzzles for the org? Get different CoP members to do different safe to fail experiments. Report back.

# Why Continuous Deployment is a Product Owner's Best Friend.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are often seen as largely technical practices, but they're not. They're social practices, hiding themselves in technology. They product practices, that have gotten a little obscured. They're management practices, to which we don't pay enough attention.

In this session, you'll learn:

* Enough about CI/CD to make better decisions,
* How Continuous Deployment will turbocharge your product management,
* Why your developers will thank you for embracing CI/CD.

# Guided Conversations: An Inclusive Format For Communities and Teams

Communities of Practice, Meetups, and teams all have something in common: they need ways of sharing information between disparate individuals. Too informal and the conversation can become unfocussed. Too formal and participants are less likely to feel involved (and organisers become too burdened).

Guided Conversations are a great middle-ground.

Guided Conversations are a lightweight, quick, focussed format for having a conversation on a particular topic. They're easy to learn, easy to run, and easy to repeat as needed.

You'll learn:

* The basics of the Guided Conversation format,
* Some quick facilitation techniques for making them smooth,
* A chance to practice with a prepared question set.

# DUMP OF IDEAS

THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACT. THIS IS A LIST OF UNFINISHED AND LIKELY BAD IDEAS.

* CI/CD: A Developers approach - Continuous and integration explained, feature toggles, branch by abstraction
* What Hurts? Pain driven process
* Whole Values (and maybe CHECKS)
* DDD and bounded contexts
* Causes of Crunch time
* Why I stopped using mock libraries - hiding code, anti-patterns in big interfaces being hidden, harder to come back to later
* Designing and testing modular code - reframing of Hexagonal Architecture talk
* "I Don't Care" - Story about Rounding up/down but BA had signed spec. Penn and Teller. Dispassion talk. Picking a less emotionally charged phrase than "I don't care".
* Shallow work - make work more interruptible and less deep through slicing, exploration, TDD, bdd. Having frequent conversations is better than having headphones on all the time
