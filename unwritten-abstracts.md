# Unwritten Abstracts

This is a list of talks for which I've written an abstract but, for one reason or another, have yet to turn it into a full
talk. If they've become full talks, they likely appear as their own repos.

Some have appeared in other forms, some have changed into other things, and the list is FAR from complete. There are
at least a dozen talks for which I've got an idea but haven't progressed them as far as needing an abstract for them.

## Quality First, Safety Throughout

The traditional software cycle sees work come from analysis, through development, checked for quality by testers, then deployed. However, there are often a number of dysfunctions in this flow. What does our flow look like when we want to deploy constantly? How do we ensure quality from the start, not at the end? More importantly, how do we take our teams from where they are to this new way of thinking while ensuring they feel safe?

## Agile Without Ceremony

Retrospectives. Standups. Sprint Planning. Agile as practiced is fully of ceremonies that people follow to understand their work. The manifesto, however, doesn't mention any of these ceremonies. What would it look like, then, if we did agile without any of the ceremonies? How could we achieve the same goals without the rituals? Let's talk about the value in each of the more common ceremonies, and consider some alternatives. Let's do Agile without Ceremony.

## TDD thing

"How can you write the tests BEFORE the thing you're testing? Madness."

Test-Driven Development, or TDD, is one of the great technical religious wars. On one side, people who want to see it burn at the stake. On the other, people who yell at non-believers with zeal. As always, the truth lies somewhere between.

During this session, you'll learn a bit more about why TDD works, why it can be tricky, and when not to use it. With practice and some simple rules, you'll see how to write code that is works, is clearer, and supports future changes more readily.

## Quality Beyond Testing / Continuous Testing

Statement (100 chars): Only testing after development drives dysfunction. Let's get quality earlier and collaboratively.

Key learnings:
* Learn how to change your teams process to get testers involved earlier.
* Explore Example Mapping as a technique for getting questions of quality asked earlier.
* See how we can go beyond our tools to have meaningful conversations about doing better.

Testing is an afterthought in far too many teams. By only involving testers after software has already been developed, we lose the opportunity to have valuable insights into what might go wrong or to explore areas that developers and product owners have yet to consider.

Moreover, in a Continuous Delivery world, this is simply no longer viable: we need quality in upfront and throughout our work. We no longer have time to find bugs later and redevelop.

We need quality beyond testing. We need testers involved throughout the process.

In this talk, I'll show you how to break out of the test column, and provide you with tools to use (like Example Mapping and Feature Toggling) in order to work better with your entire team. Through collaboration, communication, and exploration, I'll show you how to help your team from the very beginning of development, not just at the end.

{FYI: this is the same talk as Quality Beyond Testing, but with a different abstract. Let's see which works.}

## Being A Better Amigo

100 Chars: Three amigos is a good technique for test collaborating sooner. We can do better. We can make change

Learnings:

* Learn to be an effective amigo
* Figure out how you can be the star of your team by figuring out problems sooner
* Use your inquisitive nature to push you and your team to new levels

Three amigos. A technique created years ago to help testers have more of a voice in teams, earlier. Sometimes, though, it doesn't feel like that actually works. Why is that?

It's increasingly important, as delivery speed increases due to continuous integration and continuous delivery, that we improve quality, and we do so earlier in the process. Common understanding, common issues, common insight. How do we use the test mindset to break down these key problems?

Let me help you see the common dysfunctions of the three amigos sessions, and offer some advice on how we might improve.

## Example Mapping -- A Guide

100 Chars: Example Mapping is a fantastic tool for collaborating towards a shared understanding of our work.

We often struggle when it comes to figuring out exactly how we should work together, as testers, developers, business analysts, and product owners.

Three Amigos gets thrown around a lot as an idea: one to build, one to enquire, one to specify. But how do we actually run a three amigos session so that everyone gets their ideas across and we gain genuine shared understanding? That's tricky.

During this session, you'll learn to use Example Mapping; a simple, easy, and quick technique to bring everyone together for effective results.

## Collaboration Techniques with Example Mapping

Work linearly (product owner, dev, test)
Then work collaboratively (example mapping)

## Beyond Gherkin

After we've had our conversations, Gherkin has been the structure we've used to capture our needs for automation for quite some time. Gherkin isn't going anywhere but perhaps there are other forms we can use to capture conversations that are closer to how we had the conversations. Could we digitise our example mapping cards? Could we use mind maps? What other formats could we use to take us beyond Gherkin?

## WORKING TITLE: The Effective but Lazy Meetup/Guided Conversations

NOT AN ABSTRACT YET, JUST AN IDEA: Guided Conversations helped us have effective meetups that were easy to organise and lazy. Talk about Guided Conversations: the where they came from, why, how they work, strengths, weaknesses etc. Maybe talk about other things we've learned to about running meetups and organisation.

# The Sleeping Hero

NOT AN ABSTRACT YET, JUST AN IDEA: "Be a hero? I'd rather sleep." Talk about hero culture, firefighting, and why boring is better. It lets us focus on the things that matter (customers, interactions value) rather than worry about the technology.

---

# Storytelling

NOT AN ABSTRACT YET, JUST AN IDEA: I’ve often thought we should train new devs in the art of storytelling.

Stories have an arc. Scenes have a purpose. Waste is edited out.
