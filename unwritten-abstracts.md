Quality First, Safety Throughout

The traditional software cycle sees work come from analysis, through development, checked for quality by testers, then deployed. However, there are often a number of dysfunctions in this flow. What does our flow look like when we want to deploy constantly? How do we ensure quality from the start, not at the end? More importantly, how do we take our teams from where they are to this new way of thinking while ensuring they feel safe?

Agile Without Ceremony

Retrospectives. Standups. Sprint Planning. Agile as practiced is fully of ceremonies that people follow to understand their work. The manifesto, however, doesn't mention any of these ceremonies. What would it look like, then, if we did agile without any of the ceremonies? How could we achieve the same goals without the rituals? Let's talk about the value in each of the more common ceremonies, and consider some alternatives. Let's do Agile without Ceremony.

TDD thing

"How can you write the tests BEFORE the thing you're testing? Madness."

Test-Driven Development, or TDD, is one of the great technical religious wars. On one side, people who want to see it burn at the stake. On the other, people who yell at non-believers with zeal. As always, the truth lies somewhere between.

During this session, you'll learn a bit more about why TDD works, why it can be tricky, and when not to use it. With practice and some simple rules, you'll see how to write code that is works, is clearer, and supports future changes more readily.

Short bio: Gary is a software craftsmanship and agile consultant, with years of experience trying to help people write better code in a better way. Whether it's helping large companies deal with Continuous Delivery, or running local meetups, Gary spends a great deal of this time thinking about and communicating the benefits of doing things the right way first time.

The Board Whisperer

At this point in Agile's lifecycle, many teams have switched to using a Kanban Board. Some are simple, three-column trackers; others are considerably more involved. Yet, many teams don't know how to stop for a moment and _listen_ to their board. It's gently trying to nudge them about the changes that it needs to make them a better team. Come along and learn how we can go from simple to just complicated enough, smoothly.

In a new team, we started with a three-column standard to something that fits us perfectly. Our board won't work for you, but by learning how, when, and why we made our changes, you can make a board that works perfectly for your team too. See the patterns and anti-patterns; listen to the change that your board is crying out for; and enjoy the results.
