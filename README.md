# Bio etc.

The talks I've written are mostly here on Github. I thought it might be useful to new speakers to add the meta-talk project I
use for storing the stuff I need around the talks: a file with my speaker bios (I keep a few for different reasons), some 
headshots I've used recently, and the list of talks I've got abstracts for but haven't necessarily written.
