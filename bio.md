Gary is an agile provocateur, software crafter, and lean mercenary. His main hobby is to try and help companies to build better software in better ways. Sometimes this is by helping them with the messy human communication side of agile, and sometimes it's through teaching better software crafting practices - but it's usually at least some of each. Coaching, mentoring, writing, and showing; whatever helps in the context. You'll find him at various local meetups trying to both share what he knows and learn from his peers.

As an agile coach focussing on technical practices and software crafting, Gary Fleming tries to help teams fill the gaps they have when it comes time to do the work. Sometimes that means helping development teams better their testing practices, increasing their communication, or learning how to do reliable, well-structured, well-tested, continuous delivery many times per day.

Iâ€™ve spoken extensively at local meetups, as well as national and international conferences. Some videos:

100 word pitch:

I've been developing software since I was 8 years old, and love helping people find and explore better ways of building software. As well as showing people technical techniques like TDD, BDD, Hexagonal Architecture, and Mob Programming, I also like to help teams work better together. Using methods pulled from the Agile and Lean space, I try to find where teams are finding their work and collaborations painful and try to ease that pain.
